        <p className="mb-4">
          Hi, I’m Devan — a lifelong fantasy reader, board game enthusiast, and animal lover with deep roots in the countryside. I grew up on a farm surrounded by cows, horses, pigs, chickens, and wide open skies, which gave me an early appreciation for hard work, independence, and a strong connection to nature.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          My professional journey began in the hospitality industry, where I spent over 18 years delivering high-quality service, navigating fast-paced environments, and learning how to connect with people from all walks of life.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          These days, I’m channeling that energy into the world of technology — a field I find endlessly creative, challenging, and rewarding. I enjoy building clean, responsive interfaces using <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>, and I have a strong interest in Microsoft’s <strong>Power Platform</strong>, especially Power Apps and Power Automate.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Whether I’m designing apps to improve workflows or exploring new tools and techniques, I approach each project with curiosity, adaptability, and a drive to learn. Outside of tech, you’ll probably find me with a book in hand, planning my next travel adventure, or enjoying a cozy night in with my pets, friends, and a stack of board games.
